# Project

**Due: Thursday, December 16, 4:00pm CDT**

This is an empty repository for your course project.  You should add your project files to this repository, fill out the readme file, and then commit and push to complete your submission.

*If you run into a technical problem with GitHub, such as an error due to a large file size, then you can alternatively submit a Google Drive link to download a zip file of your project.  In this case, you should add the link to the Submission Information below and commit the readme file to the repository .* 

## Submission Information

You should fill out this information before submitting your project.

**Team Members**:

List all members of your team here.

**Third Party Assets**:

Make sure to document the name and source of any third party assets such as 3D models, textures, or any other content used that was not solely written by you.  Include sufficient detail for the instructor or TA to easily find them, such as a download link.

**Project Description**:

Provide a general overview of your project and describe each of its functions.

**Instructions**:

Provide instructions for running and testing your project's various features.  These should clearly describe how to use each of your project's functions so that the instructor can understand how to use it properly.

## Rubric

Graded out of 80 points. 

1. UI Contribution (25).  How significant is the UI contribution of the project? Is the project simply an application, or does it have a substantial focus on new UI technology? How novel and creative is the system?
2. Technical Complexity (25). Projects should represent a substantial implementation effort.
3. Usability (25).  Does the project work as intended?  Are there any serious usability problems or bugs?  
4. Documentation (5).  Are all the functions sufficiently described in the documentation?  Are the instructions clear?

Make sure to document all third party assets in your readme file. ***Be aware that points will be deducted for using third party assets that are not properly documented.***

## Submission

You will need to check out and submit the project through GitHub classroom.  **Make sure your APK file is in the root folder.** Do not remove the `.gitignore` or `README.md` files.

Please test that your submission meets these requirements.  For example, after you check in your final version of the assignment to GitHub, check it out again to a new directory and make sure everything opens and runs correctly.  You can also test your APK file by installing it manually using [SideQuest](https://sidequestvr.com/).

If your project is intended for use on a PC with Oculus Link, then you should include a Google Drive link to download a zip file of your build folder instead of an APK file.
